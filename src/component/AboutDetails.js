                        <h1>Our story</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Zoonders story started from a simple need. <br />
                            To provide a better, more improved relationship between pet owners and their pets. <br />
                            Though many pet owners exist, the many challenges that pet owners face when trying to feed, medicate, and groom their pets can make pet ownership tiring. As pets, they also need to socialize and build a community too. <br />
                            All these challenges and then some can make pet lovers and enthusiasts reconsider adopting a furry buddy. <br />
                            Zoonders is a one-stop-all online pet platform (or a pet app, if you wish) for anything and everything you need for your beloved pets, from excellent grooming and medical service with the top pet groomers and veterinarians to a wonderful community of pet owners to help you and your pet build a fantastic society. We are a team of pet owners and veterinarians with love for pets and understand the immeasurable value of companionship that your pets provide.
