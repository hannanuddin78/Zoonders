                            <p className="dtParr">You’d be surprised at how pet friendly a lot of cities are these days. With the growing trend of bringing your four-legged friends on outdoor adventures, many establishments have done away with antiquated “No Pets” policies. However, it is important to confirm beforehand so that you don’t waste the effort of getting your pet ready for travel. Possible places to visit include grocery stores, department stores, salons, restaurants, and even entertainment stations. <br />
                                Zoonders lets you search up places near you and learn about their pet policies and amenities!

                            <h4>Never Get Thrown Out Again</h4>
                            <p>Little is worse than going out of your way to drive to a café with your pet and learning that your little friend isn’t allowed in. Save yourself the trouble (and a bit of time) by using our built-in map service to filter out all the places that won’t accommodate your pet.</p>
                            <h4>Learning and Growing Map Details</h4>
                            <p>We strive to have a 100 percent accurate map to make your life as easy as possible. To this end, our map service can be added to or updated by all Zoonders users. If a location has recently amended their pet policies, then the map listing can be quickly changed.</p>
                            <h4>Safety First – For your Pet and Others</h4>
                            <p>Bringing your pet to public places requires a certain amount of trust. If your pet has known behavioral problems or isn’t fully vaccinated, then it may pose a danger to others. If pet-related incidents occur, then businesses may choose to stop catering to pets of all kinds.</p>

                                Think of Zoonders as the Facebook of the pet world. It is a free social network platform designed to connect local pet owners into a community. Pet profiles can include photos, videos, and other information about each pet and even allows users to video call or chat with one another. Zoonders offers pet news for an extensive library of useful information. Not to mention, the app works on a global scale, and exists anywhere that a strong pet community can form. <br />
                                We also consolidate all your pet’s needs into one marketplace, so you don’t need to open up dozens of tabs to get everything your pet requires. Such as food, preventative care, brushes, and many other things. Our vendors are connected with pet stores and provide products that have been vetted by veterinarians for safety. <br />
                                Zoonders is committed to helping the increasing number of stray animals around the world. Our pet adoption services connect would-be pet owners with those looking to rehome their pet. This gives animals the smoothest transition from one loving home to the next. <br />
                                So, if you’re an owner looking to spice up your pet’s life with new activities, friends, toys, and challenges, then Zoonders is the app for you!

//                                 With the help of our users, Zoonders has joined to fight to end the suffering of animals across the globe. Puppy mills, premature euthanization, and intolerable living conditions are just a few of the problems we seek to fix. <br />
//                                 By creating communities in every area, we are able to directly connect your funds with your local animal shelters. You’ll know exactly where your donations are going, and they’ll even help raise the overall quality of the neighborhoods you live in. Nobody likes to see stray or sick animals in their area. Most of these institutions are heavily underfunded and understaffed leading to a decreased quality of life for the animals in their care. <br />
//                                 Apart from the local level, we are looking to alleviate some of the big problems for animals in Pakistan by starting our own animal shelter there. Each year, roughly 50,000 dogs alone are killed in Pakistan, a number that can be heavily reduced through compassionate donations. <br />
